# Healthcare is too important to be closed.

## We live in a closed healthcare system.
The algorithms that drive our care to our clinical and life data to hospital and treatment pricing, are governed by blackbox services.

By using these closed systems, we are actively designed out of the decision-making process, in favor of corporate “optimized care” for optimized returns (vs optimized health outcomes). The crooked biases built into software, implemented with intent or accidentally, need interrogation, citizen collaboration, and correction.

**It’s our health.**

**Our very lives are at stake.**

## We demand that our healthcare services be open
to inspect and correct bias,

to be accessible for rapid innovation and evolution,

and to become more valuable as more patients, clinicians, clinics, companies, and governments engage in healthcare for all.

#### Missionette:
## We imagine, design, build, ship, and deliver open source healthcare services.
Our focus is
1. Policy Visualization & Evaluation
2. Patient Health Literacy
3. Encounter & Decision Support
